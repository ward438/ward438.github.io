                My name is Robert Ward. I am in my mid to late 30's. I am married to a
                beautiful lady by the name of Samantha. I have to wonderfuly beautiful
                kiddos, ages 4 and 7. I was born in West Germany and lived there as a
                child and was raised primarily in south Texas in the Corpus Christi area.
                I joined the army in my 20s and was stationed in Schweinfurt, Germany.
                It was a fantastic city sitting smack dab in the middle of Bavaria. I
                couldn't have asked for a better garrison. In 2008 I deployed to the
                Wasit Province of Iraq near Al Kut on FOB Delta. Super fun... I
                honorably discharged shortly after return to Germany after the
                deployment. It wasn't long until I met my wife. We met while I was
                living on South Padre Island. We moved to Kentucky for a short time and
                were married shortly after. Not going to get into the details, but we
                had two wonderful children after that! We moved to Baton Rouge, LA after
                some time but found it lacking as a place to raise a family. So off to
                east Texas we went. My wife's family is from this area and here we are.

                I was an artillery mechanic in the Army and moved into heavy equipment
                repair for the better part of ten years. It was a decent career, but it
                took too much of a toll on my physical well-being. I transitioned
                careers over to GTAW pipe welding. Also a decent choice. But tig welding
                in fixed positions for long hours was equally taxing on my body. Not too
                mention the 10-12 hour, 6 day a week minimum schedule. I decided to
                transition once more to a new career. Software development is the best
                choice I can think of. So here I am!

                I enjoy playing pc games, xbox, hanging out with my wife and children
                and playing guitar. I am starting to develope a nice collection of
                guitars now. I have a nice Epiphone GS 400 Pro, old Ibanez dreadnought
                acoustic, Taylor 114E Grand Symphonym, and the gem of them all... my
                Taylor GS Mini Koa Plus. Anyway, this was fun. Thanks for reading.
